- The [Development](./development/setup.md) header is the best place to get started on developing on top of and with webscan
- See the [Docs](./docs/index.md) section for a comprehensive rundown of webscan capabilities

# About webscan

webscan is designed as a simple, easy to use web application scanning tool that security teams can use to automate the collection of data about their web applications. Designed with data-modeling and data-integration needs in mind, webscan can be used on its own as an interactive CLI, orchestrated as part of a broader data pipeline, or leveraged from within the Method Platform.

The types of scans that webscan can conduct are constantly growing. For the most up to date listing, please see the documentation [here](./docs/index.md)
